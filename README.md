## StringManager -- Mac OSX Project

 As we all known Xcode 8.0 does not support plugin. [StringManage](https://github.com/Loongwoo/StringManage) does not work anymore. So I create a osx version.

### What can StringManage do?

- show all the strings in Localizable.strings
- add/remove/search strings
- check every string is used or not and jump to the referenced line

### Install
clone this repo, Build the project and it's done!

### Usage

Use <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> to open a project.
